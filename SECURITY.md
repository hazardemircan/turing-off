Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by:

1. **Email**: Send details to [hazardemircan.dev@outlook.com] with "TuringOff Security" in the subject line
2. **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use the "Report a vulnerability" button in the Security tab of this repository

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: We aim to acknowledge your report within 48 hours
- **Status Updates**: We'll provide regular updates on our progress every 7 days
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical issues within 30 days

### Safe Harbor

We support responsible disclosure and will not pursue legal action against researchers who:

- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations and data destruction
- Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission of the account holder
- Do not access or modify others' data
- Report the vulnerability promptly
- Do not disclose the issue publicly until we've had a chance to address it

### Recognition

We believe in recognizing security researchers who help keep TuringOff safe:

- We'll acknowledge your contribution in our release notes (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
- We'll list you in our security researchers hall of fame
- For significant findings, we're happy to provide a letter of recommendation
